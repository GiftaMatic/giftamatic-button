# GiftaMatic Button

The GiftaMatic button is a package developed by the giftamatic team to add authenticity to your giftamatic campaigns by adding click to donate button. 

We incentivize people for donating on your crowdfund campaigns.

The GiftaMatic Button is easy to use, you just need to create your campaign on the [giftamatic.org](https://giftamatic.org) and then import this button in your website.

```javascript

<GiftaMaticButton account="<ADD_YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY>" campaignId="<ADD_THE_ID_FROM_CAMPAIGN_URL>" />

```

You can find the campaignId from the last digits of the sharable url of campaign.

example: https://giftamatic.org/10lkjjssj20hfsj20Sf/123 
Then 1234 is your campaignId and 10lkjjssj20hfsj20Sf is your public key to recieve funds.

```

With Love from GiftaMatic team.
